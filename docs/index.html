    <h2 align="left">Accomplishments</h2>
    <p>So far we have adapted our rendering code from Project 4 to accomodate a simulation of a small solar system consisting of a sun and several planets. It runs very smoothly compared to the cloth simulations from Project 4.</p>
    <h2 align="left">Preliminary Work</h2>
    <p>We initialize the solar system by supplying the location, mass, initial centripetal velocity, and radius of each planet. We then use Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation to compute every gravitational force acting on each body, followed by the Modified Euler's Method to update the bodies' positions and velocities. The approach will likely not scale well to larger galaxies since computing the gravity acting on every body this way is O(n^2), so therefore much of our future work will be towards optimization, as well as researching and implementing more advanced simulation techniques.</p>
    <h2 align="left">Progress</h2>
    <p>We are behind our original schedule, as we underestimated the difficulty of the tasks we listed in said schedule. As such, our plan is to experiment with ways of making the N-body simulation scale better, such as spatial hashing or quadtrees, more advanced numerical approximation algorithms, and alternative approaches that compute the energy of a body instead of the force acting on it. We are unlikely to simulate planetary collisions but will still attempt to do so if we have time.</p>
